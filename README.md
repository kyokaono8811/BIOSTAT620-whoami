# Intro to Health Data Science

You need to make a fork of this repository, find your name in the list below, and replace it with something like:

```md
[**@username**](https://github.com/username/) something about you
```

You can also add a small picture at the end. It's optional (but fun!) and can come from anywhere on the internet just by adding a link to the image file. Here is the code I used to create my intro, which you can use as a template:

```md
[**@dmcable**](https://github.com/dmcable) I'm Dylan, and I am adopting my first dog, named Appa, this month. <img src="https://singlecellspatialanalysis.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-07-at-3.36.04%E2%80%AFPM-768x759.png" alt="profile pic" width="40px">
```

Look for your GitHub username and add a link to your Github profile and something about
yourself you don't mind sharing publicly. Remember to only modify the line with your
name! If you don't see your name, just add it at the end of the list.

Once you are done, submit a
[Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) to include your information in the original
repository (the `dmcable` version).
